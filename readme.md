**project description:**
A social media platform where users can share their lives and browse posts from others â€” similar to Instagram.

**Frontend:**
The interface should be visually appealing, with smooth and intuitive interactions and animations. The website should use responsive design to ensure a good user experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.

**Backend:**
The core database logic is based on two main document collections: users and posts.
The platform supports features such as likes, bookmarks, follows, comments, publishing, and deleting posts.
Users can also upload images and other files, which allows them to update their profile pictures or attach media to their posts.
